//QNO3:-Can We Assign The Value To The Static varible Into Main Method If The Local Varible Is Present

//Answer:-No We Can't Assign The Value To The Static Varible If The local Varible Is Present Becuse
//1:-In Firstly Seacrhes For Loacl Varible Before Its Line If It IS Not Present
//2:-Then It Serches For The Static Varible

//On Such Case If You Try To Initialize Value To The Static Varible
//The You HAve To Take Help OF Class Name AS Refernce
